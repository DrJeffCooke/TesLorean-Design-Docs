Charging Protocol for TesLorean
===============================

Initialization Requirements
---------------------------
- Key in 'Accessories' (#1) position
- Handbrake On
- Drive Unit confirmation of Neutral gear
- "Charge" button pressed on the keypad
- EVSE plugged in OR wait until EVSE plugged in

INITIATING CHARGING SEQUENCE
- Trip computer requests charge readiness status
	- from Thermal Controller
	- from Battery Control Module
	- from Charge Controller
- Thermal Control confirms readiness for charging, and if not why
- Battery Control Module confirms readiness for charging, and if not why
- Charger Controller confirms readiness for charging, and if not why
- Trip Computer signals to Charge Controller to start charging

CHARGE CONTROLLER INITIATING CHARGING
- Charger Controller requests that Battery Control Module closes contactors for charging
- Battery Control Module signals that contactors are closed
- Charger Controller initiates charging
- Charger Controller signals that charging is underway
	- Thermal controller receives and begins charger temp mgt
	- Trip Computer receives and updates internal status and enables KeyPad charging lights
	- Instrument controller displays charging message and status on OLED displays, updates charge gauge
- Charger selects and manages the charge profile

CHARGE CONTROLLER WHILE CHARGING
- Battery Control Module reports (frequency = ?) on the status percentage of the battery charge
- Battery Control Module monitors individual cell voltages, detects over or uneven charging and reports
- Thermal Controller will monitor, manage and report on thermal status and events

END OF CHARGING EVENTS
- Charger reports that battery is fully charged
- Charging interrupted and why (heat/cold/EVSE/overcharged cell conditions)

CHARGE SHUTDOWN SEQUENCE
- Charger Controller requests the Battery Control Module opens the contactors
- Battery Control Module confirms that the contactors are open
- Charger signals that charging is completed
- Trip Computer updates internal status and updates the KeyPad lights
- Thermal Control Module removes all control actions
- Instrument cluster updates gauge and OLED displays
